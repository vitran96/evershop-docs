# EverShop – An Open-Source Node Ecommerce Platform Introduction

Welcome to the EverShop. A Node Ecommerce Platform!

EverShop is an open-source [Node ecommerce platform](/) that helps developers developing their e-commerce store. EverShop is a flexible platform built on a module system, with extensible options for both the admin panel and the front store.

EverShop also offers rich functionality, enabling merchants to develop a web store that meets their business requirements.

EverShop is free and open-source. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/evershopcommerce/evershop)

## Technology stack

EverShop's highly modular structure is a result of several open source technologies embedded into a stack. These open source technologies are composed of the following components:

### NodeJS

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.

### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. EverShop requires PostgreSQL 13 or higher.

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. EverShop implements server-side rendering of React components with hydration to provide a fast, performant experience and SEO optimization.

### GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. EverShop uses GraphQL and React to build a flexible and extensible front-end.

Heavy inspired by Shopify, we have a fully-featured admin panel using React that allows you to manage your store.

The admin panel is also designed to be extensible and customizable. Developers can easily add new features to the admin panel without modifying the core source code.

## Front store view - React Graphql Ecommerce
