## Technology stack

EverShop's highly modular structure is a result of several open source technologies embedded into a stack. These open source technologies are composed of the following components:

### MySQL

### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. EverShop implements server-side rendering of React components with hidration to provide a fast, performant experience and SEO optimization.

### GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. EverShop uses GraphQL and React to build a flexible and extensible front-end.
